# Reinforcement Learning

This repository is meant to provide sample solutions for the exercises of the book Reinforcement Learning by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. You can find and download the book as pdf [here](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf).

Be aware, all the solutions are worked out by myself and there might be mistakes in the answers and code.

This repository will be updates constantly as I'm progressing through the book.
